Translates the gobbledygook on your gas bill into legible information.

If you have been paying your gas bills over the course of several years
and cannot answer the simple question of how much gas costs, then I submit that 
the gas bill you recieve, which specifies the cost breakdown, fails to 
clearly reveal that information.

Indeed, I applaud the gas company for their efforts to make a gas bill as
confusing as possible. I couldn't have done a better job if I were charged
with the task myself, hence the drive for making this simple javascript app. 

In Canada, we have done away with the penny. Why then are prices listed, not
just in cents, but to an accuracy of 4 decimal places? Simply listing 
what the price is, is apparently not enough either - price adjustments
are also included as a separate cost. I don't give a @#%$ what the price
adjustment is. I just want to know the price without doing any math. 

And of course, it's not just the gas you pay for. There is also delivery, 
storage, and transporation. And these have their own respective price 
adjustments too. And sometimes there is not one, but two sets of price 
adjustments if the adjustment has changed in a new month billing period. 
Oh yes, and there's the monthly fee. 

So for one gas bill, you could potentially have 17 seperate listed costs!
Sheesh!

So to help those of you answer some basic questions about the cost of 
gas you consume, I give you this form. The app will answer the cost of gas 
question, but alas, that too comes at a,...cost. One, the tedious task 
of filling out all the fields and two, the realization of a couple of
disturbing truths.

Namely, the portion of your money that you pay your supplier that covers 
the cost of JUST the gas. You may find it a bit lower than expected. 

Also, price gouging. Summer is the time of lower gas consumption for 
heating your home, so any gas price increases then are less noticeable on 
a bill formatted in the confusing way that it is. 

Hope this sheds some light on your bill.
